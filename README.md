# Bioinformatics Outreach Nigeria

This the main repository for the Bioinformatics Outreach Nigeria (BON) project.

The `index.html` page is used for creating our website, which uses the "Read Only by HTML5 UP" template provided in the [GitHub Pages Starter Guide](https://iqss.github.io/github_pages_guide/template.html).

The "HTML5Upâ€™s Read Only" template is shared under the html5up.net project by @ajlkn

To add new section, follow the structure provided in the index page.

You can also use [markdowntohtml](https://markdowntohtml.com/) to help you convert markdown to html.

Just a super simple single-page responsive template built for personal sites and portfolios
(although it'd definitely work for other stuff too). Includes a contact form, pre-styled
elements, and Sass sources.

you can use for pretty much whatever.

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
